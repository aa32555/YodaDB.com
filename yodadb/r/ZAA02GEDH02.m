	;;1000,1,2;screen environment designed exclusively for creating and
	;;1000,1,3;editing MUMPS routines.  Included with the Editor is a Code
	;;1000,1,4;Library function with which commonly used code can be stored
	;;1000,1,5;and recalled when needed. ;
	;;1000,1,6;
	;;1000,1,7;While editing a routine, each programmer is provided a
	;;1000,1,8;~<workspace>~.  Since this workspace is disk-based, there is no
	;;1000,1,9;size limit and programmers can leave the Editor and return
	;;1000,1,10;without fear of losing work in progress.  The Editor even
	;;1000,1,11;remembers the position of the cursor so that it can begin
	;;1000,1,12;at the same point when programmer returns to it. ;
	;;1000,1,13;
	;;1000,1,14;Each programmer can also configure the Routine Editor to
	;;1000,1,15;satisfy his or her environmental preferences.  Such options
	;;1000,1,16;include the intensity of the display, tab settings, 80 vs. ;
	;;1000,1,17;132 column mode, and whether menus should be hot-keyed or
	;;1000,1,18;require a carriage return when selecting an option. ;
	;;1000,1,19;
	;;1000,1,20;Additional information is available on the following
