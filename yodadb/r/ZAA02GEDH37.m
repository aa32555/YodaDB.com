	;;16030,1,9;is 1 (true) any commands to the right of the ELSE are not
	;;16030,1,10;executed.  ELSE does not take an argument. ;
	;;16040;Command:  FOR||30
	;;16040,1,1;~<Examples:>~
	;;16040,1,2;  FOR I=7,"B"

	;;16040,1,7;
	;;16040,1,8;~<Explanation:>~  FOR specifies the repeated execution of all
	;;16040,1,9;the commands following it on the line.  There are three
	;;16040,1,10;formats.  First is the expression format in which a local
	;;16040,1,11;variable is assigned a value such as 7, or BD. ;
	;;16040,1,12;
	;;16040,1,13;Second is the range format in which a local variable is set
	;;16040,1,14;to an initial value and then incremented or decremented in
	;;16040,1,15;specified steps until it reaches or exceeds a limiting val-
	;;16040,1,16;lue; in the second example, the initial value 2, the incre-
	;;16040,1,17;mental step is 4, and the limiting value is 20.  Note that
	;;16040,1,18;in this case 18 is the last value of J for which the associ-
	;;16040,1,19;ated commands will be executed. ;
	;;16040,1,20;
	;;16040,1,21;The third format is the "endless loop" format in which the
	;;16040,1,22;loop is broken only by execution of a QUIT or GOTO command
	;;16040,1,23;within the instructions following the FOR command. ;
	;;16040,1,24;
	;;16040,1,25;Any of these formats may be mixed (except for the argument-
	;;16040,1,26;less format).  Note that a QUIT or GOTO command will termin-
	;;16040,1,27;ate all forms of the FOR loop, not just the "endless loop"
	;;16040,1,28;form, and that a QUIT will terminate only the most recent
	;;16040,1,29;in a series of nested FOR loops, whereas GOTO will termin-
	;;16040,1,30;ate all active FOR loops. ;
	;;16050;Command:  GOTO||11
	;;16050,1,1;~<Examples:>~
	;;16050,1,2;  GOTO NEXT
	;;16050,1,3;  G ^RTN
	;;16050,1,4;  G LABEL^RTN
	;;16050,1,5;  G @VAR
	;;16050,1,6;
	;;16050,1,7;~<Explanation:>~  GOTO transfers execution of code to a line of
	;;16050,1,8;code in the current routine (e.g., G NEXT), to the first
	;;16050,1,9;line of another routine (e.g., G ^RTN), or to a specified
	;;16050,1,10;line in another routine (e.g., G LABEL^RTN).  If return of
	;;16050,1,11;control is required, use the DO command. ;
	;;16060;Command:  HALT||8
	;;16060,1,1;~<Examples:>~
	;;16060,1,2;  HALT
	;;16060,1,3;  H
	;;16060,1,4;
	;;16060,1,5;~<Explanation:>~  Terminates execution of the current process
	;;16060,1,6;after doing necessary housekeeping, such as issuing a LOCK
	;;16060,1,7;command with no arguments, closing all devices owned by the
	;;16060,1,8;process.  HALT does not take an argument. ;
	;;16070;Command:  HANG||9
	;;16070,1,1;~<Examples:>~
	;;16070,1,2;  HANG 3
	;;16070,1,3;  H SECONDS
	;;16070,1,4;
	;;16070,1,5;~<Explanation:>~  HANG suspends execution for the number of
	;;16070,1,6;seconds specified by each argument (such as 3 or TIME).  If
	;;16070,1,7;an argument is less than zero, execution is suspended for
	;;16070,1,8;zero seconds.  Note that HANG ~(always)~ has an argument, while
	;;16070,1,9;HALT ~(never)~ has an argument. ;
