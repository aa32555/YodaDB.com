	;;2190,1,4;~<Routine Selection>~.  All routine selection in the AA UTILS'
	;;2190,1,5;utilities operate in the same manner.  Once you have become
	;;2190,1,6;familiar with the steps involved, you will find the process
	;;2190,1,7;to be powerful and easy-to-use. ;
	;;2190,1,8;
	;;2190,1,9;~(Step 1)~.  ~(Identify the source of the routines)~.  There are
	;;2190,1,10;four possible sources of routines for use by the utilities:
	;;2190,1,11;the programmer's ~<workspace>~, the common ~<workfile>~, the rou-
	;;2190,1,12;tine ~<archive>~ and routine ~<releases>~.  For example, when prin-
	;;2190,1,13;ting a listing you can (1) list the routine currently in
	;;2190,1,14;your workspace, (2) list the current versions of a selected
	;;2190,1,15;set of routines in the workfile, (3) list the most current
	;;2190,1,16;versions of routines from the routine archive, or (4) list
	;;2190,1,17;the versions of routines from the archive which have been
	;;2190,1,18;linked to a particular release of a package. ;
	;;2190,1,19;
	;;2190,1,20;When the Routine Listings utility is used, the first ques-
	;;2190,1,21;tion asked will be the source of the routines.  Note that
	;;2190,1,22;some utilities are limited to certain sources.  Because of
	;;2190,1,23;this, not all the sources will be available for each
	;;2190,1,24;utility.  The process of selection, however, remains the
	;;2190,1,25;same. ;
	;;2190,1,26;
	;;2190,1,27;Type the first character of the desired source, or use the
	;;2190,1,28;cursor movement keys to move the selector to highlight it
	;;2190,1,29;and press [RETURN].  If you select workspace as the source,
	;;2190,1,30;routine selection is complete since the workspace can
	;;2190,1,31;contain only one routine. ;
	;;2190,1,32;
	;;2190,1,33;If the selected source is a release, proceed to Step 3. ;
	;;2190,1,34;

	;;2190,1,36;archive are selected as the routine source, you will be
