	;;14140,1,16;(Tn) on the left is separated from its result expression on
	;;14140,1,17;the right by a colon.  There may be one or more pairs in
	;;14140,1,18;the series, but at least one of the truth-valued expressions
	;;14140,1,19;must be true. ;
	;;14150;Intrinsic Function:  $TEXT||27

	;;14150,1,2;  $TEXT(L1)            ...where L1 is a line label
	;;14150,1,3;  $T(L1+I2)            ...where I1 is an integer expressing
	;;14150,1,4;                       an offset from L1
	;;14150,1,5;  $T(+I1)              ...where I1 is an absolute offset
	;;14150,1,6;                       from the beginning of a routine
	;;14150,1,7;  $T(^R1)              ...where ^R1 is a routine name

	;;14150,1,11;~<Examples:>~
	;;14150,1,12;  $T(LINE)             The text of the line labeled LINE
	;;14150,1,13;  $T(LINE+3)           The text of the third line after LINE
	;;14150,1,14;  $T(+2)               The text of the second line
	;;14150,1,15;  $T(+0)               The name of the routine
	;;14150,1,16;  $T(LINE^RTN)         The text of line LINE in routine ^RTN
	;;14150,1,17;  $T(^RTN)             The first line of routine ^RTN
	;;14150,1,18;
	;;14150,1,19;~<Explanation:>~  $TEXT returns the text of a specified line of
	;;14150,1,20;the current routine, including the line-start indicator and
	;;14150,1,21;label.  Lines may be referenced by label (L1), by a positive
	;;14150,1,22;offset from a label (L1+I2), or by a positive offset from
	;;14150,1,23;the beginning of the routine (+I1).  If the specified line
	;;14150,1,24;does not exist, the empty string is returned.  Text from
	;;14150,1,25;another routine can be obtained by following the label (L1)
	;;14150,1,26;or label plus offset (L1+I2) by a circumflex (^) and the
	;;14150,1,27;routine name. ;
	;;14160;Intrinsic Function:  $TRANSLATE||15
	;;14160,1,1;~<Syntax:>~
	;;14160,1,2;  $TRANSLATE(E1,E2)
	;;14160,1,3;  $TR(E1,E2,E3)

	;;14160,1,7;  $TR(35.63,".")          3563
	;;14160,1,8;
	;;14160,1,9;~<Explanation:>~  $TRANSLATE returns the string E1 modified by
	;;14160,1,10;replacing every character in E1 that matches the nth char-
	;;14160,1,11;acter in E2 with the nth character in E3.  If the nth char-
	;;14160,1,12;acter in E3 is null, each character in E1 that matches the
	;;14160,1,13;nth character in E2 is deleted.  In the two argument form,
	;;14160,1,14;each occurrence of every character in E2 is removed from
	;;14160,1,15;E1. ;
	;;14170;Intrinsic Function:  $VIEW||4
	;;14170,1,1;~<Explanation:>~  $VIEW is an implementation-specific function
	;;14170,1,2;available, at the option of the implementor, for providing
	;;14170,1,3;implementation-specific data.  Refer to documentation sup-
	;;14170,1,4;plied with your implementation of MUMPS. ;
