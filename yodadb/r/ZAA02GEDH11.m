	;;1400,1,56;  When a "/L" (upper or lower case) is typed at the end of
	;;1400,1,57;  string to be found, the editor will clear the editing
	;;1400,1,58;  window and display only those lines which contain the
	;;1400,1,59;  string to be found.  This is most useful when context is
	;;1400,1,60;  unimportant or when scanning a routine to determine if
	;;1400,1,61;  the string occurs anywhere in the routine.  It is not
	;;1400,1,62;  limited by the weaknesses of Interactive Mode and also

	;;1430,1,2;
	;;1430,1,3;This function enables the insertion of new, blank lines into
	;;1430,1,4;a routine which can be left blank, used for additional code
	;;1430,1,5;or internal comments.  The only restriction is that lines
	;;1430,1,6;may not be inserted between the beginning and ending row of
	;;1430,1,7;a single, wrapped line of code. ;

	;;1430,1,10;to insert a line and press the INSERT LINE function key. ;

	;;1440,1,12;The function is not required to add text to the end of a

	;;1440,1,15;
	;;1440,1,16;When inserting text in a line, the cursor is moved to the
	;;1440,1,17;position at which the new text is to begin and the INSERT
	;;1440,1,18;CHARACTER key causes the remainder of the line to be moved
	;;1440,1,19;to the following row to allow the entry of text.  You can
	;;1440,1,20;press EXIT any time to abort the insertion, or press
	;;1440,1,21;[RETURN] to complete it. ;

	;;1440,1,23;~(Step 1)~.  Move the cursor to the location at which text is
	;;1440,1,24;to be inserted and press the INSERT CHARACTER key.  Any
	;;1440,1,25;remaining characters on the current row will be moved to
