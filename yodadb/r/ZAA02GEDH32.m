	;;14070,1,12;~<Explanation:>~  $GET returns the value assigned to V if V has
	;;14070,1,13;a value, or the value resulting from expression E1.  If E1
	;;14070,1,14;is not supplied, it is assumed to be an empty string (""). ;

	;;14080,1,2;  $JUSTIFY(E1,I2)  ...where E1 is an expression and I2 is
	;;14080,1,3;                   an integer
	;;14080,1,4;  $J(N1,I2,I3)     ...where N1 is a number and I2 and I3
	;;14080,1,5;                   are integers

	;;14080,1,12;
	;;14080,1,13;~<Explanation:>~  $JUSTIFY with 2 arguments returns the value
	;;14080,1,14;of expression E1, right-justified within a field of size I2. ;
	;;14080,1,15;However, if I2 is less than or equal to the length of E1,
	;;14080,1,16;the value of E1 is returned unchanged. ;
	;;14080,1,17;
	;;14080,1,18;When 3 arguments are provided, the numeric interpretation
	;;14080,1,19;of N1 is formed, rounded to have I3 decimal places, includ-
	;;14080,1,20;ing trailing zeroes, and the result is right justified in a
	;;14080,1,21;field of length I2. ;

	;;14090,1,1;~<Syntax:>~
	;;14090,1,2;  $LENGTH(E1)      ...where E1 is an expression resulting
	;;14090,1,3;                   in a value
	;;14090,1,4;  $L(E1,E2)        ...where E2 yields a value which is con-
	;;14090,1,5;                   tained in the value yielded by E2

	;;14090,1,10;  $L("ABCA","A")   3
	;;14090,1,11;
	;;14090,1,12;~<Explanation:>~  $LENGTH returns the number of characters in
	;;14090,1,13;string E1; that is, it returns the length of E1.  When two
	;;14090,1,14;arguments are provided, the number returned is the number-
	;;14090,1,15;plus-one of non-overlapping occurrences of E2 in E1. ;
	;;14100;Intrinsic Function:  $ORDER||16
	;;14100,1,1;~<Syntax:>~
	;;14100,1,2;  $ORDER(VN)        ...where VN is a local or global varia-
	;;14100,1,3;                    ble name

	;;14100,1,8;  $O(ST("Z")        ""
	;;14100,1,9;
	;;14100,1,10;~<Explanation:>~  $ORDER returns the next existing subscript, in
	;;14100,1,11;collating sequence, from the array specified by VN.  The
	;;14100,1,12;empty string ("") is used to find the first subscript, and
	;;14100,1,13;is returned when VN specifies the last subscript contained
	;;14100,1,14;in the array.  The ordering sequence arranges al canonic
	;;14100,1,15;numeric subscripts in numberic sequence, followed by all
	;;14100,1,16;other subscripts in ASCII collating order. ;
