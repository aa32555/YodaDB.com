	;;2150,1,11;information regarding selection of routines is covered in
	;;2150,1,12;~<Conventions>~.  Note that unlike other utilities, the source
	;;2150,1,13;of the routines is preselected for you (the ~<workfile>~). ;

	;;2150,1,15;~(Step 3)~.  Confirm the purge by typing [Y] and [RETURN] at
	;;2150,1,16;the prompt.  Purging will begin immediately and proceed

	;;2170;Search Routines Utility||31
	;;2170,0,"Conventions";2190
	;;2170,1,1;This utility searches selected routines for occurrences of
	;;2170,1,2;a specified string.  When a routine is found that contains
	;;2170,1,3;the string, a header line is printed for each routine, as
	;;2170,1,4;well as each line in the routine which contains the string. ;
	;;2170,1,5;For each line, the offset from the beginning of the routine
	;;2170,1,6;is provided as well as the line label, if any. ;
	;;2170,1,7;
	;;2170,1,8;Routines can be searched from any of three sources:
	;;2170,1,9;
	;;2170,1,10;  ~<Workfile>~       Latest version of routines in workfile. ;
	;;2170,1,11;
	;;2170,1,12;  ~<Archive>~        Latest version of routines in archive. ;
	;;2170,1,13;
	;;2170,1,14;  ~<Release>~        The versions of routines in the archive
	;;2170,1,15;                 which belong to a release. ;

	;;2170,1,24;
	;;2170,1,25;~(Step 3)~.  Select the routines to be searched.  Additional
	;;2170,1,26;information regarding selection of source and routines is
	;;2170,1,27;covered in ~<Conventions>~. ;
	;;2170,1,28;
	;;2170,1,29;~(Step 4)~.  Select the output device, and its left and right
	;;2170,1,30;margins.  Additional information regarding selection of
	;;2170,1,31;output device and margins is also provided in ~<Conventions>~. ;
	;;2180;Search Routines and Replace||42
	;;2180,1,1;This utility searches selected routines for occurrences of
	;;2180,1,2;a specified string, replaces the string with another string
	;;2180,1,3;and documents the change in report form. ;
	;;2180,1,4;
	;;2180,1,5;A header line is printed for each routine which is found to
	;;2180,1,6;contain the string, as well as the old and new versions of
	;;2180,1,7;each line that is changed.  An offset from the beginning of
	;;2180,1,8;the routine is provided for each line in addition to the
	;;2180,1,9;line label, if any. ;
	;;2180,1,10;
	;;2180,1,11;You can search routine from any of the following three
	;;2180,1,12;sources.  However, routines which are changed during the
	;;2180,1,13;process will be saved to the workfile, just as if they had
	;;2180,1,14;been loaded, edited and saved. ;
