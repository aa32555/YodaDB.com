	;;16110,1,12;executing each argument, LOCK releases all previously spec-
	;;16110,1,13;ified exclusive claims to resources. ;
	;;16110,1,14;
	;;16110,1,15;If any arguments are specified, new temporary exclusive
	;;16110,1,16;claims are established to the named resources.  If another
	;;16110,1,17;user has exclusive claims on a resource named, the current
	;;16110,1,18;process (that is, the one executing the LOCK command)
	;;16110,1,19;remains suspended awaiting the availability of that
	;;16110,1,20;resource. ;
	;;16110,1,21;
	;;16110,1,22;A "timeout" can be affixed to any argument of LOCK to abort
	;;16110,1,23;an unsuccessful wait.  (Note that a series of named
	;;16110,1,24;resources must be placed in parentheses, as for L (B,G(4)),
	;;16110,1,25;but that parentheses are not required around the name of a
	;;16110,1,26;single resource.)
	;;16110,1,27;
	;;16110,1,28;LOCK has no effect on the value or definition of existing
	;;16110,1,29;variables or on the "naked indicator". ;
	;;16110,1,30;
	;;16110,1,31;Incremental LOCKing (e.g., L +^INDEX) will not affect any
	;;16110,1,32;previously LOCKed values (i.e., they remain LOCKed), but
	;;16110,1,33;each incremental LOCK of the same value is counted and must
	;;16110,1,34;be decrementally LOCKed (e.g. L -^INDEX) as many times as
	;;16110,1,35;it was LOCKed before it is released. ;
	;;16120;Command:  NEW||25
	;;16120,1,1;~<Examples:>~
	;;16120,1,2;  NEW
	;;16120,1,3;  N A,SAVE
	;;16120,1,4;  N (A,SAVE)
	;;16120,1,5;
	;;16120,1,6;~<Explanation:>~  The NEW command temporarily removes variables;
	;;16120,1,7;the removed variables are returned to their original $DATA
	;;16120,1,8;status and value (if any) upon QUITing (explicitly or imp-
	;;16120,1,9;licitly) out of the current DO or XECUTE.  Only local,
	;;16120,1,10;unsubscripted variables can be used in the argument of a
	;;16120,1,11;NEW command. ;
	;;16120,1,12;
	;;16120,1,13;Without arguments, NEW temporarily removes all existing
	;;16120,1,14;local variables, including descendant values. ;
	;;16120,1,15;
	;;16120,1,16;When an argument is specified, the local variables named in
	;;16120,1,17;the argument are temporarily removed along with their des-
	;;16120,1,18;cendants.  In the second example, local variables A and
	;;16120,1,19;SAVE are removed. ;
	;;16120,1,20;
	;;16120,1,21;The third example shows the "exclusive" form of NEW which
	;;16120,1,22;is a special form in which the argument is a series of un-
	;;16120,1,23;subscripted local variables (such as A and SAVE) contained
	;;16120,1,24;in parentheses;  all local variables are temporarily
	;;16120,1,25;removed except those named and their descendants. ;
	;;16130;Command:  OPEN||13
	;;16130,1,1;~<Examples:>~
	;;16130,1,2;  OPEN 4
	;;16130,1,3;  O 7:(devparms):1
	;;16130,1,4;
	;;16130,1,5;~<Explanation:>~  The OPEN command is used to obtain exclusive
	;;16130,1,6;ownership of a device.  It does not affect the "current
	;;16130,1,7;device" with which the routine is interacting.  Implementa-
	;;16130,1,8;tion specific device parameters may be placed after a
	;;16130,1,9;device name.  Ownership is relinquished upon execution of
	;;16130,1,10;the CLOSE command. ;
	;;16130,1,11;
	;;16130,1,12;A "timeout" may be affixed to any argument to abort an
	;;16130,1,13;unsuccessful attempt to OPEN that device. ;
