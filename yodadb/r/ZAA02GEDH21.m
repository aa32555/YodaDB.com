	;;2310,1,36;subscript substitution is desired, enter the subscripts to
	;;2310,1,37;be substituted at the appropriate level.  Note that
	;;2310,1,38;subscript substitution is not possible for levels in which
	;;2310,1,39;a range has been specified, or for which no subscript has
	;;2310,1,40;been specified. ;

	;;2320;Global Edit Utility||187
	;;2320,1,1;The AA UTILS Global Editor displays selected portions of
	;;2320,1,2;any global, allows you to page forward from the starting
	;;2320,1,3;reference and back, and even screen out nodes in which you
	;;2320,1,4;have no interest.  Further it allows you to interactively
	;;2320,1,5;add new nodes and edit or delete existing ones. ;
	;;2320,1,6;
	;;2320,1,7;~(Step 1)~.  From the Functions menu, select Utilities. ;
	;;2320,1,8;         From the Utilities menu, select Global. ;
	;;2320,1,9;         From the Global Utilities, select Edit. ;
	;;2320,1,10;
	;;2320,1,11;~(Step 2)~.  Select the global to be displayed.  AA UTILS'
	;;2320,1,12;Global Editor provides a powerful masking feature that
	;;2320,1,13;allows you display as much, or as little, of the selected
	;;2320,1,14;global as you need.  This masking abides by several rules. ;
	;;2320,1,15;
	;;2320,1,16;  ~<Rule 1>~  Subscripts do not need surrounding quotations
	;;2320,1,17;  marks unless they contain a comma or colon.  However, if
	;;2320,1,18;  quotes are used, they must be paired.  Examples:
	;;2320,1,19;
	;;2320,1,20;  ^GLO(A)             Is the same as ^GLO("A")
	;;2320,1,21;
	;;2320,1,22;  ^GLO("1A")          Could have been ^GLO(1A)
	;;2320,1,23;
	;;2320,1,24;  ^GLO(A:Z)           Is the same as ^GLO("A":"Z")
	;;2320,1,25;
	;;2320,1,26;
	;;2320,1,27;  ~<Rule 2>~  Global references which have a closing paren-
	;;2320,1,28;  thesis will limit the number of levels of the global to
	;;2320,1,29;  be displayed.   Once displayed, the number of levels can
	;;2320,1,30;  be changed interactively.  When using the closing paren-
	;;2320,1,31;  thesis, a null subscript will select all all subscripts
	;;2320,1,32;  at the requested level.  Examples:
	;;2320,1,33;
	;;2320,1,34;  ^GLO()              Display all nodes at top level
	;;2320,1,35;
	;;2320,1,36;  ^GLO(,,)            Display all nodes at top three levels
	;;2320,1,37;
	;;2320,1,38;  ^GLO(A,)            Display all nodes at top two levels
	;;2320,1,39;                      in which "A" is top level subscript. ;
	;;2320,1,40;
	;;2320,1,41;  ^GLO(A:E,)          Display all nodes at top two levels
